. Keyboard and mouse event handling
. Audio integration in JavaScript
. Clean and aesthetic UI design

- 🛠 Tech Stack
HTML5 – Structure
CSS3 – Styling & responsiveness
JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – Logic & sound handling

🚀 How It Works
Each piano key is assigned a keyboard key code
JavaScript maps these keys to corresponding audio files

When a user:
presses a keyboard key or
clicks a piano key
→ the mapped sound plays instantly
A temporary active class adds visual feedback to pressed keys
